  /// This routine can be called multiple times. The caller does not need to align input data lengths to block sizes; input is bufferred as necessary for block ciphers.
  ///
  /// When performing symmetric encryption with block ciphers, and padding is enabled via kCCOptionPKCS7Padding, the total number of bytes provided by all the calls to this function when encrypting can be arbitrary (i.e., the total number of bytes does not have to be block aligned). However if padding is disabled, or when decrypting, the total number of bytes does have to be aligned to the block size; otherwise CCCryptFinal() will return kCCAlignmentError.
  ///
  /// A general rule for the size of the output buffer which must be provided by the caller is that for block ciphers, the output length is never larger than the input length plus the block size. For stream ciphers, the output length is always exactly the same as the input length. See the discussion for CCCryptorGetOutputLength() for more information on this topic.

  /// Generally, when all data has been processed, call CCCryptorFinal().

Encrypting or decrypting with a block cipher with padding disabled, when the total amount of data provided to CCCryptorUpdate() is an integral multiple of the block size. 2. Encrypting or decrypting with a stream cipher.
